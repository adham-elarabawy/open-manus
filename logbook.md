I am just summarizing these, since I didn't write logs for some of the sparse earlier work I did here.

First, I created a bare-bones test to recreate the servo gearbox from scratch. The goal here was to prove that I can replicate the gearbox in a parameterized manner, such that I can integrate it into the body of the finger for compactness.

Then, I built a simple enclosure around it, since the gearbox was snagging due to plate flexture.

</div>


Then, I experimented a bit with magnetic encoder placement.

</div>

Then, I added an end-effector to get a better feel for the motor torque.

</div>

Then, I did some more work around the encoder to better conform to the narrow specifications for the distance between the magnet and the encoder itself. I also connected the encoder to the end-effector to be able to couple their movements for easier testing.
